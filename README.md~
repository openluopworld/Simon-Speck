# Simon-Speck

# C++
Implement on VS2010<br>
C++_1 is the earliest implementation. Without knowing the << and >> operation in C++, an int is used to stand a bit. Therefore, it is very inefficient<br><br>
C++_2 uses << and >> operation to implement rotate shift left and rotate shift right.<br>
For example, we can use '(X<<n)|(X>>(32-n))' to implement 'rotate shift left X with n bits' on the assumption that X is an unsigned int.<br><br>
C++_3 is a more efficient and simpler implementation of Simon. Speck has not been implemented yet.<br>
Just change the value of 'SIMON_BLOCK_SIZE' and 'SIMON_KEY_WORDS', then run it. The pair of values can be (64, 3), (64, 4), (128, 2).

# AVR
Implement on Atmel Studio<br>
Simon64/128 and Speck64/128 are implemented on Minimal RAM and High-Throughput condition<sup>[1]</sup>.<br>
Some instructions such as <b>adiw</b> and <b>cpi</b> can be used to reduce the number of code.<br>

# AVR_for_Triathlon
Implement on Atmel Studio<br>
Two Scenarios: 1)128 bytes in CBC mode; 2) 128 bits in CTR mode<sup>[2,3]</sup><br>
Just like the triathone, <b>some data such as master keys and counter are not stored in flash. They are just initialized in RAM.</b>

# Triathlon
Try to implement simon and speck on ARM according to the interface provided in [3]. Only key schudule, one block of encryption and decryption
 is implemented now. And the correctness of the program is not verified.
