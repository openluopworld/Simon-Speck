# Simon-Speck
C implementation is moved to <a href="https://github.com/openluopworld/block_ciphers" target="_blank">here</a>

### AVR
Implement on ATmega128, IDE is Atmel Studio 6.2.<br>
Simon 64/128 and Speck 64/128 are implemented for Minimal RAM and High-Throughput according to paper <i>The SIMON and SPECK Block Ciphers on AVR 8-Bit Microcontrollers.</i><br>

### Triathlon
Simon 64/128 and Speck 64/128 are implemented on 3 platfrom(AVR, MSP and ARM) according to paper <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/lwc-workshop2015/papers/session7-dinu-paper.pdf"><i>FELICS - Fair Evaluation of Lightweight Cryptographic Systems</i></a><br>. The code is just a trying. So there must be errors since the correctness is not verified. If you want to learn the code, you can visit <a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/FELICS" target="_blank">here</a> to get the source code.
